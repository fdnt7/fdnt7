## Gender

<!-- Gender: Summary -->
### <span id="gender-summary">Summary</span>

> I identify as **[Non-binary](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Non-binary)**, specifically as a **[Demigirl](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Demigirl)**. In summary, I don't identify as strictly male or female, but I lean more towards femininity than masculinity
>
> I go by the pronouns **She/Her** and **They/Them** in the order of descending preference, as stated in the GitHub profile's pronoun section.

> [!NOTE]
> I am comfortable with being referred to as a *girl*, a *woman*, or any similar term. I am also comfortable with being referred to as *non-binary* or *enby*. Words like *guy*, *man*, *dude*, and *bro* I personally perceive as gender-neutral and am fine with them being used about me. However, I do find it offensive to be referred to as *male*.
